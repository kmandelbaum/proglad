# Proglad - Program Gladiators

## What
This is a competitive programming platform for running interactive games between bots submitted by participants.

The following points drive the design and implementation
* Focus on interactive games rather than running participants' code against pre-defined tests. That mode can be trivially supported as a "1-player" game but is not the focus. There are plenty of platforms that do that.
* Implement a resource-constrained server-side execution, similar to how traditional competitive programming platforms do it. No massive ML models or AI for now, but if the model fits into the constraints, great, we encourage to use any working approach!
* Run a diverse, ever-growing set of games, potentially contributed by the community, with a coherent but flexible communication protocols. All games should feel the same in how they communicate, but each should present a unique challenge in choosing the strategies. Adding new games should be made easy.
* Different kinds of games to consider: multiplayer and single-player, antagonistic and cooperative, symmetric and asymmetric, turn-based (consecutive and simultaneous turns) and real-time games.

## How to Compete
Register on the website, find an interesting game to compete in, submit a bot in one of the supported programming languages and see how it performs.
