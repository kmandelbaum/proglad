  <h1>What</h1>
    <p>
      Proglad is a competitive programming platform where bots written by participants play games by some predefined rules.
      It is different from some of the popular competitive programming platforms in that it focuses on interactions between programs,
      as opposed to running a fixed sets of tests. It is also different from (AI) challenges
      where bots need to play a game on their own and achieve maximum score. The platform supports either mode:
      they can be considered 1-player games.
    </p>

  <h1>How to play</h1>
  Register, choose a game from the menu available at <a href="../games">Games</a>, write your bot in the language of your choice,
  upload it and observe how it performs against other bots, viewing stats and game replays.

  <h1>Contributing a game</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>You can navigate to the new game editing page from <a href="../games">Games</a> or directly through this <a href="../edit_game">link</a></li>
      <li>Fill in the form, upload game server source code, game description, rules (only markdown is supported for now)
        and an icon that will be visible on the Games page (only svg is supported for now).
